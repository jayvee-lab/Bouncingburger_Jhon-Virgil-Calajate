🍔 HHUMBER-GER – Animated Burger with Name Label
HHUMBER-GER is a simple yet entertaining desktop animation made with Python's Tkinter and Pillow. It features a bouncing burger image with your name gracefully floating along for the ride. Every time the burger hits a wall, your name flashes with fun new colors — because even burgers deserve to party on impact! 🎉

🧠 “Even the smallest idea can bounce its way into brilliance.”
🤖 “Why did the burger bounce? Because it couldn't ketchup with life standing still.”

This light-hearted project is perfect for beginners learning GUI programming in Python, or anyone who just wants to see a burger come to life and bounce around like it has places to go 🍔💨.
